# What is `libdft`

- Open source binary-level taint tracking library
- Byte-granularity taint-tracking system built on Intel Pin
- Supports only 32-bit x86
  - althogh you can use it on a 64-bit platform
- Relies on legacy versions of Pin
- Supports only for "Regular" x86 instructions,
  - not for extended instruction sets like MMX or SSE.

<note>
<code>libdft</code> is based on Pin (between 2.11 and 2.13)

64-bit version of <code>libdft</code> : https://github.com/AngoraFuzzer/libdft64

# Internals of libdft - Overview

- Shadow Memory
  - how to store taint info
- Virtual CPU
  - how to propagete taint info
- The libdft API and I/O interface
  - how to instrument

---

# Internals of libdft - Shadow Memory

### Bitmap (1 colour)

- Supports only 1 taint colour.
- Slightly faster and less memory than STAB.

---

# Internals of libdft - Shadow Memory

### STAB : Segment Translation Table (8 colour)

- Supports 8 taint colour.
- Contains one entry for every memory page.
- Each entry contains an _addend_ value,
  - which is a 32-bit offset from a virtual memory address.
- Obtained address ( VMA + offset ) contains the correcponding shadow byte.

---

# Internals of libdft - Virtual CPU

- _Virtual CPU_ keeps track of the taint status of CPU register.
  - This is stored in memory as a special data structure.
- Virtual CPU is a kind of shadow memory.
  - for each of 32-bit general-purpose CPU registers.

<note>
32-bit general purpose register of x86:
<code>edi</code>,
<code>esi</code>,
<code>ebp</code>,
<code>esp</code>,
<code>ebx</code>,
<code>edx</code>,
<code>ecx</code>,
and <code>eax</code>

# Internals of libdft - libdft API and I/O interface

- `libdft` provides a taint tracking API.
- Two import tools for building DTA tools is those that
  - manipulate tagmap (Tagmap API)
  - add callbacks and instrument code

### Tagmap API

- `tagmap_setb()` : sets status of tagmap
- `tagmap_getb()` : gets status of tagmap

  - <red>add callbacks and instrument code</red>

### API for adding callbacks and instrumentation code

- `syscall_set_pre()` and `syscall_set_post()` : register callbacks for syscall events.
- `syscall_desc[]` : store syscall pre- and post-handlers
- You can alse register callbacks for instructions using `ins_set_pre` and `ins_set_post`.

---

# Taint Policy

- `libdft` taint policy defines the following classes of instructions.
- Each of these classess define how to propagete and merge taint.

1. ALU : arithmetic and logic instruction such as `add`, `sbb`, `and`, `xor`, `div`, and `imul`
2. XFER : instructions that copy a value such as `mov`. Simply copies the taint info.
3. CLR : (=clear), instructions that reset taint info of output opperands
4. SPECIAL : instructions that require special rules
5. FPU, MMX, SSE : instructions `libdft` doesn't supports. Doesn't propagete taint info, causing undertainting.
